# Robocopy Log Parse

*The log as a table, not a wall of text.*

## Overview

**Robocopy Log Parse** runs on your own PC. Parse a Robocopy log into copied, skipped, failed, and a short summary.

Robocopy logs are long. You want failed paths.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- Failed paths CSV
- Summary counts
- Multiple logs
- UTF-8

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
